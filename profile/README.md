**ClinicianFOCUS** is part of the **"Unburdening Primary Healthcare: An Open-Source AI Clinician Assistance Platform"** Applied Research Project. This initiative is funded by the **Conestoga College New and Emerging Researcher Grant+ (CNERG+)** program as well as project partner **Dr. Braedon Hendy**.

Led by **Principal Investigator Prof. Michael Yingbull**, a computer science professor at Conestoga College in Waterloo, Ontario, along with research partner **Dr. Braedon Hendy**, this project is focused on reducing burdens faced by primary care practitioners in clinican settings through an open-source AI enabled-platform that enhances efficiency and streamlines clinical tasks and care. 

## Key Goals
- Develop a **real-time AI partner** and related tools to assist clinicians during patient encounters.
- **Automate documentation tasks** and provide proactive assistance in the clinical workflow.
- Ensure **security and scalability** in all developed solutions, with a focus on privacy and ethical standards.
- Release all developed code under the **AGPL v3+** license to promote customization and further innovation sharing in the healthcare community.

This platform aims to be a transparent, customizable tool for healthcare providers in clinical settings.
Work began September, 2024. Feel free to follow our progress and efforts here!
